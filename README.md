## Conclusion
Code testing is greatly aided by unit tests. They aid in the discovery of faults and coding flaws. They also aid in improving the stability and dependability of the code. Large projects with a lot of code and commercial projects benefit greatly from it. Time and money are saved as a result. Finding bugs in the code is more challenging in the absence of unit tests.
